I tried modularizing the app, but any time I try to bring in my service, I get an error: Cannot read property '1' of null.  

After hours of googlings, asking and general trouble shooting, I am still not sure what is happening here.  

At the moment, I have my PlanetCtrl set up with the Service, but it's not working due to this error.  However, I have left my ResidentCtrl as is (with the get request in the controller), to illustrate that modularization is working, but upon trying to import the service, it breaks and causes the same error.
